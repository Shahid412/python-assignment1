I . Write a program that does the following in order:
1) Asks the user to enter a number “x”
2) Asks the user to enter a number “y”
3) Prints out: a. The sum of x and y
b. The difference when y is subtracted from x
c. The product of x and y
d. The quotient when x is divided by y
e. The remainder when x is divided by y
f. The result of log10 x
g. The result of x y

II . Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room in meters. Once
these values have been read (as floating-point numbers), your program should compute and
display the area of the room. Include units in your prompt and output message.

III. Create a program that displays a multiplication table that shows the products of all
combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up to and including 9 times 9. Your multiplication table
should include a row of down the left side consisting of the iterating variable i taking the values
1 through 9. The output should look like:
i =  1  :  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
i =  2  :  2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
i =  3  :  3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27
i =  4  :  4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36
i =  5  :  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45
i =  6  :  6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54
i =  7  :  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63
i =  8  :  8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72
i =  9  :  9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
Tip: To print out a value without moving down to the next line can be accomplished by adding end="" as the last argument to your print statement. For example, print("A") will display the letter A and then move down to the next line. The statement print("A", end="") will display the letter A without moving down to the next line, causing the next print statement to display its result on the same line as the letter A. More on output formatting can be found on python’s official documentation page: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html 

IV . After a catastrophe that left several injured visitors, an amusement park that exhibits genetically engineered prehistoric creatures is determined to entice people back in by temporarily lowering the price of admission based on the age of the guest. 
Guests 3 years of age and less are admitted without charge. 
Children between 4 and 11 years of age cost £899.90. 
Seniors over 69 years and over cost £1490.49. 
Admission for all other guests is £1999.99 
Craft a program that begins by reading the ages of all of the guests in a group from the user, with one age entered on each line. 
The user will enter a blank line to indicate that there are no more guests in the group. 
Then your function should display as it’s only output the admission cost for the group with an appropriate user-friendly message. 
The cost should be displayed using two decimal places. Tip: The park aims to introduce a new “asset” that is sure to increase the number of visitors. 
To offset the expense in developing new genetic modification techniques, the entry prices will increase in the future. Babies will probably be charged for entry then. 
Make your program easy to update, planning for this future change in pricing (use variable names that make sense for this). 

V . The Chinese zodiac assigns animals to years in a 12-year cycle. 
One 12-year cycle is: 
2000 - Dragon 
2001 - Snake 
2002 - Horse
2003 - Goat 
2004 - Monkey 
2005 - Rooster 
2006 - Dog 
2007 - Pig 
2008 - Rat 
2009 - Ox 
2010 - Tiger 
2011 - Rabbit 
The pattern repeats from there, with 2012 being another year of the dragon, and 1999 being another year of the hare. 
Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays the animal associated with that year. 
Can you make it work for any year greater than or equal to zero?
